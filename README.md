# Cognitev-Internship-Technical-Task
This task is to: 
1. create a RESTful campaign resource. Campaign data will be:
   * Name 
   * Country
   * Budget
   * Goal
   * Category. If category is not provided, I used this [API](https://ngkc0vhbrl.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/api/?url=https://arabic.cnn.com/) to extract it.
2. Create a reporting endpoint that accepts:
   - **Dimensions** (used to group data by these fields)
   - **Fields** (Array of fields to return in each campaign)
   - **Duration** [start and end dates]
3. **Develop a UI** to draw the analysis results generated from the analyze service (mentioned
in point 2)
